This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

## Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm
```{r function definition MH Algorithm}
X <- seq(-100, 100,length = 201)
g <- rnorm(10000, 2, 5)
f <- rgamma(10000, 2, 5)

MHAlgorithm = function(X, f, g){
  # function inputs: dataset X
  for(t in seq(0, 10, length=10)){
    xmean = mean(X)
    g[x[t]]
    mhRatio = 
      x[t] # value of x[t] becomes xstar
  }
  
}

}
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
